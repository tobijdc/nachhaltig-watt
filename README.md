# Nachhalting Watt  ðŸŒ±âš¡

Experimental Firefox Browser Extension.
Adds ["Stromanbieter Check"](https://www.wwf.at/stromanbietercheck/) Sustainability data to
the Austrian [E-Control price comparison Website](https://www.e-control.at/tarifkalkulator#).

## Background

### ðŸ’¡ Idea

Consumers should have easy access relevant Sustainability information, to make informed choices.

### Reasoning

Information on [E-Control price comparison Website](https://www.e-control.at/tarifkalkulator#)
only contains some sustainability information.
While you can filter for "Only renewable" and "only from Austria",
there are still criteria missing.

 - was all the certificates of electricity bought together with the electricity itself?
 - does the company (or it's parent company) sell fossil energy?

Furthermore, there is a certificate
["Umweltzeichen UZ46"](https://www.umweltzeichen.at/de/produkte/gr%C3%BCne-energie),
that ensures certain good standards, as an additional indicator.

Last but not least, there is ["Stromanbieter Check"](https://www.wwf.at/stromanbietercheck/),
which scores companies for their (very broad) sustainability practices.

## Still to do

 - [x] does not break when switching to smaller viewports
 - [ ] works on smaller viewports
 - [ ] add  how much electricity was bought together with certificates
 - [ ] add UZ46 indicator
 - [ ] map all (very) regional companies
 - [ ] proper extension releases
 - [ ] chrome version
 - [ ] i18n
 - [ ] expand to tarife.at
 - [ ] expand to durchblicker.at
